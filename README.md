### 2022-2023

- A dim theme for [PeaZip](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip) ! Not a dark mode but better than nothing | [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/themes/Dim_Theme_v2.theme.7z)  
**BUG REPORTED :** sometimes, it's showing enlarged icons (which is *NOT* good). In that case, extract the 7z, and remove the `96` folder. Recreate the archive **(pay attention to end it by `.theme.7z`, else it won't work !!)**. If you still have icons size bugs, do the same and remove the `48` folder. If it persists, remove the `32` one. Removing the `16` one will make all icons disappear, *which is not what we want 🥲*  
**EDIT** : PeaZip includes an actual dark theme since [v9.7.1](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/releases/tag/9.7.1), so I recommend you to upgrade
- A small file to enable in 1 second the Dark Mode in Windows (works even if you can't access the settings) | [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/themes/darkmode.reg)
- Useless script that list all files on your hard disk with a matrik-like theme | [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/scripts/matrix.bat)
