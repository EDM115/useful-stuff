## Random files that can be used for a lot of things... ðŸ™‚

- A dim theme for [PeaZip](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip) ! Not a dark mode but better than nothing. [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/themes/Dim_Theme.theme.7z)
- A small file to enable in 1 second the Dark Mode in Windows (works even if you can't access the settings). [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/themes/darkmode.reg)
