## Random files that can be used for a lot of things... ðŸ™‚

- A dim theme for [PeaZip](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip) ! Not a dark mode but better than nothing [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/themes/Dim_Theme_v2.theme.7z)  
**BUG REPORTED :** sometimes, it's showing enlarged icons (which is *NOT* good). In that case, extract the 7z, and remove the `96` folder. Recreate the archive **(pay attention to end it by `.theme.7z`, else it won't work !!)**. If you still have icons size bugs, do the same and remove the `48` folder. If it persists, remove the `32` one. Removing the `16` one will make all icons disappear, *which is not what we want ðŸ¥²*
- A small file to enable in 1 second the Dark Mode in Windows (works even if you can't access the settings) [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/themes/darkmode.reg)
- The connexions points GIF of Microsoft 365 [Download](https://github.com/EDM115/useful-stuff/raw/main/images/Microsoft-loading.gif)
